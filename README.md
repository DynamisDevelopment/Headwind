## Changes

* Colons in responsive classes converted to dashes to work in a sass compiler, so `md:bg-blue-500` becomes `md-bg-blue-500`.

Since the smalled breakpoint I generally design for is 350px, it made sense to change `sm` to something a bit more useful.

* `sm` - 320px 
* `md` - 650px 
* `lg` - 1024px
* `xl` - 1280px
